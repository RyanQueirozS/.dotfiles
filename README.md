# .dotfiles
My most important config files

## I use vim and arch btw
I used packer nvim, but because it got discontinued and lazy is now the big
think, i've updated my distro. I primarilly use it for C++ and Golang.

In regards to Arch. I use i3 Window Manager with xorg, it's simple and has just what I need.

## Kitty
I've tried alacritty, I've trie kitty, and I just don't see a relevant reason
to choose one over another. Alacritty seems easier to customize, but kitty, for
some reason, just seams simpler to me. For now I will just continue to use
kitty.

## Final considerations
I recomend my dotfiles for those who want simple, non fancy stuff. And even if
you dont fit in that description, try it and tell me what you think I could
improve, or just customise it to your own liking.
